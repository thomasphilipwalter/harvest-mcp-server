# Harvest Natural Language Time Entry MCP Server

An MCP server that lets you log Harvest time entries using natural language, including special handling for leave requests. This server makes time tracking more intuitive by understanding natural language inputs and automatically handling common scenarios like leave requests.

## Features

- 🗣️ Natural language time entry parsing
- 🏖️ Special leave request handling (e.g., "I'm off sick today")
- ⏰ Configurable work day hours
- 🌍 Timezone support
- 🎯 Automatic project and task matching
- 📅 Smart date parsing (today, yesterday, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- A Harvest account
- Personal access token from [Harvest Developer Tools](https://id.getharvest.com/developers)
- Account ID (shown on the same page as your token)

## Installation

### Installation

1. Install the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/desktop)

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrian-dotco/harvest-mcp-server.git
cd harvest-mcp-server
```

3. Install dependencies and build:
